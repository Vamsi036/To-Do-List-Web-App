@To-Do List Web App
This is a basic To-Do List web application developed using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

What I Did
1) Created a structured HTML layout with:
  - An input field for entering tasks
  - An "Add Task" button
  - A task list container using <ul> tag
  - 
2) Styled the app using basic CSS for readability and usability

3) Wrote JavaScript to:
  - Add new tasks to the list dynamically
  - Mark tasks as complete using a completed class toggle
  - Add a  remove button for each task
  - Remove tasks from the list when the button is clicked
  - Prevent page reload â€” updates are shown instantly

4) Used DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple state logic without any libraries

Tech Stack:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
